# TITI'GAS Website

The TITI'GAS Website is designed as a `MERN` (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) Stack project to enhance development skills and showcase a workout tracking application. It allows users to log and manage their workout routines, making it easier to track fitness progress over time.

# Technologies Used

## Frontend

- `React.js:` Used for building a dynamic and interactive user interface.

- `Tailwind CSS:` For styling the UI with a utility-first CSS framework.

- `shadcn:` A component library that works seamlessly with Tailwind for pre-styled, accessible components.

## Backend

- `Node.js & Express.js:` The server is built using Node.js and Express to handle API requests and serve the backend functionality.

- `MongoDB:` The database used to store workout data, with Mongoose as the ODM (Object Data Modeling) library.

## Libraries and Tools

- `Nodemon:` Automatically restarts the server during development when file changes are detected.

- `Mongoose:` For MongoDB object modeling, making it easier to define schemas and interact with the database.

- `bcrypt:` Used for securely hashing and managing user passwords.
